You can still request enrolment at a school that is not your designated neighbourhood school.\\r\\nThat school can only accept your enrolment if there is sufficient capacity at the school.  \\r\\nIf a school has some capacity, but not enough to fit everyone from outside its zone, the school uses the Placement Policy to determine enrolments\\r\\n \\r\\nSchool zones are based on proximity, in some cases zone have been adjusted in recognition of significant accessibility issues, e.g. presence of a ‘hard barrier’. Adjustments are minimised to stay consistent and transparent with the standard methodology.\\r\\n \\r\\nSome considerations to explore:\\r\\nZones do no align current nor forecast student demand / population to school size / capacity\\r\\nIn metropolitan areas, zones are defined by voronoi polygons not by road connectivity or public transport options\\r\\nSometimes there is tension between adjusting a zone to population or for improved accessibility and whats fair and equitable for schools\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an FAQ link on the findmyschool.vic.gov website that explains zones in more detail\\r\\nhttps://www.education.vic.gov.au/parents/going-to-school/Pages/zones-restrictions.aspx\\r\\n</td>\n",

       "9   The ACT Population Projections 2018 to 2058 (https://apps.treasury.act.gov.au/snapshot/demography/act) point us to some exciting and challenging facts for us to manage into the future \\r\\n\\r\\n- By the year 2022 the ACT population is projected to reach over 452,000 people from the current (2019) 420,000.\\r\\n- We are projected to reach 500,000 by 2029 and 703,000 by 2058.\\r\\n\\r\\nA growing population is more than just the numbers. The shape of our community, and our city, will also change. As our population changes, we will look for different places, and ways, to live. We will seek out new employment opportunities and new ways to travel between our homes, schools, places of work and places of recreation. We will continue to care about the impact of our actions on both the built and natural environment.

       "27  We are seeking to help the small and informal community groups who have formed to support families or children to make their lives better. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese groups might be urban, rural or remote, they might only focus on a specific part of the community (e.g. local teenagers), or a particular issue (e.g. creating safe and supportive places to meet).  However, what they have in common is needing the right data to tell their story:\\r\\n- to explain how and why they are making a difference and who for, \\r\\n- to identify gaps and the next steps in further supporting their community, and\\r\\n- so they know where to focus next and who to collaborate with or if they need other resources. \\r\\nCan you create a way to support one of these groups (perhaps one working on an issue that you already know about) to tell their story? \\r\\n\\r\\nHaving the data they need to tell their story can help a group to:\\r\\n- clarify what they are doing and who they are helping,\\r\\n- test and re-design activities to better meet the needs in their community, \\r\\n- seek support (social, financial and political), and \\r\\n- decide when and how to collaborate with other groups with similar goals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NDIS demand map provides an example of how data sources might be brought together to help new group (in this case potential NDIS providers) with gaps or next steps.  It shows the potential demand for disability services in a region.\\r\\nhttps://blcw.dss.gov.au/ndis-demand-map/.  \\r\\n\\r\\nA successful challenge might do something similar for another issue, or take this one-step further.  It would support local groups after they have identified the need for their work, to help them find out about their community context and to re-design social programs, by knowing what activities are making a difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nChallenges do not need to incorporate DSS data.

       "49  #### Smart Cities, Smart Liverpool, Smart Pedestrian Project\\r\\nThousands of people walk through Liverpool’s City Centre every day and, through the Smart Pedestrian Project, the paths they take will help shape the city’s future.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiverpool City Council will count pedestrian and vehicle movements around the city centre, collecting data from smart devices and camera-counting technology. The data will be stripped of any identification and relayed and collected for analysis by researchers from University of Wollongong.\\r\\n\\r\\nCouncil will then use this data to inform planning decisions and respond to the rising number of residents and workers making their way around the city centre every day.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Our Partners\\r\\nCouncil secured an Australian Government Smart Cities and Suburbs grant to jointly fund the project.\\r\\n\\r\\nCouncil is working with IT Integration Company Meshed and the University of Wollongong to deliver the technology. Meshed will supply the network and develop a wi-fi smart device counter. The university will develop the people-counting technology and data analysis.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### The Technology\\r\\nSensors placed in key locations around Liverpool City Centre will connect through a Low Power Wide Area Network or LoRaWAN.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoRaWAN is a low-cost network that connects wireless battery-operated devices across a wide area. It operates on low bandwidth, meaning it can only transmit small packets of data, but its low power consumption allows extremely long battery life. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis makes it ideal for collecting data, such as pedestrian and vehicle movements or air quality.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Further questions:\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can people and vehicle counting sensors and air quality sensors be used to improve a user's experience of their city?\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can businesses take advantage of existing sensors and IoT networks to their own advantage?\\r\\n\\r\\nHow might local businesses or residents be engaged with existing IoT infrastructure?\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can data/sensors be used by Councils to better plan for the development of the city? I.e. where are high pedestrian counts? Do bicycle counts align with future planned bike routes? Is there enough pedestrian infrastructure in areas with high counts of pedestrians (i.e. seats/bins/lighting)? Are the most likely routes taken by visitors into the city centre? Are these routes well served by wayfinding signage?\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "51  As our urban and regional centres grow we increasingly rely on public services to efficiently and sustainably transport citizens. The winning entry will use data and modern technologies to drive a positive public transport outcome. We encourage teams to adopt a novel technical approach and to 'think big'. Your entry may focus on public transport in the context of a specific locality, region, state or country - but should offer insights or capabilities that can be broadly applied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "54  In Victoria, all children are entitled to be enrolled at their designated neighbourhood school as a right under the legislation. Designated neighbourhood schools are generally the public school within closest proximity to the student’s permanent residential address, unless the Minister for Education or Regional Director has restricted the zone of the school. \\r\\nFor children residing in metropolitan areas, Ballarat, Bendigo or Geelong, the designated neighbourhood school is usually the nearest public school in a straight line from your child’s permanent residential address. In any other area of Victoria, it is the nearest school by the shortest practicable route by distance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll public primary and secondary schools, including Prep/Foundation to Year 9 and multi-campus schools have zone maps. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English Language Schools and Select Entry Schools. Specialist schools also do not have zones and have special enrolment criteria.\\r\\n \\r\\nSchool zones help parents know their rights and also help schools manage their enrolment pressure. You can still request enrolment at a school that is not your designated neighbourhood school.\\r\\nThat school can only accept your enrolment if there is sufficient capacity at the school.  \\r\\nIf a school has some capacity, but not enough to fit everyone from outside its zone, the school uses the Placement Policy to determine enrolments\\r\\n \\r\\nSchool zones are based on proximity, in some cases zone have been adjusted in recognition of significant accessibility issues, e.g. presence of a ‘hard barrier’. Adjustments are minimised to stay consistent and transparent with the standard methodology.\\r\\n \\r\\nSome considerations to explore:\\r\\nZones do no align current nor forecast student demand / population to school size / capacity\\r\\nIn metropolitan areas, zones are defined by voronoi polygons not by road connectivity or public transport options\\r\\nSometimes there is tension between adjusting a zone to population or for improved accessibility and whats fair and equitable for schools\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an FAQ link on the findmyschool.vic.gov website that explains zones in more detail\\r\\nhttps://www.education.vic.gov.au/parents/going-to-school/Pages/zones-restrictions.aspx\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

Your entry can be in the form of a feature article or video report.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an example of the type of thing you could do check out this example using our popular baby names API https://vimeo.com/357271039\\r\\n\\r\\nFor inspiration you can take a look at: \\r\\nhttps://datajournalism.com/\\r\\nhttps://datajournalismawards.org/\\r\\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jul/28/data-journalism\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

IP Australia is looking for creative ways of visualising the dataset and/or creating interfaces that showcase the value of TM-Link and how it can be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

Searching Trove may result in finding previously unknown references, leading to a better understanding of how people lived.\\r\\n\\r\\nShowcase this bank of knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease refer to https://www.firstlanguages.org.au/resources/reporting when including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages in the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "69  Universally, farmers, researchers and members of the agribio industry need to know ‘what’s the nature of the soil at this location’? Is it sandy, organic matter rich, full of clay?

       "      <td>Innovation precincts are place-based innovation ecosystems. They usually have a widely understood geographic extent; a shared sense of identity amongst those involved; and a strong set of formal and informal networks and partnerships between people and businesses, researchers, education and training organisations and government. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is strong evidence innovation precincts improve collaboration and innovation outcomes that contribute to business and economic growth. They facilitate sharing of resources, ideas, challenges and opportunities, and help businesses to access talent. They also create amenities and value for surrounding communities, and can contribute to urban renewal projects and drive regional economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many existing and planned innovation precincts in Australia. However, the scale of many of these precincts is much lower in Australia than in North America or Europe, and their full potential is arguably less widely understood. Some of the challenges and opportunities to consider are:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Information on innovation precincts’ areas of specialisation and assets, along with local supply chain opportunities, infrastructure and human capital, can guide business decisions to establish or expand operations in a particular location. It can also guide governments to target infrastructure investment and program design.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Successful innovation precincts are locally led and based on local competitive strengths, innovation potential and needs. They should be integrated into surrounding communities and into local, regional, national and international networks and supply chains.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The value of innovation precincts in encouraging end-user focused collaborative research, commercialisation and innovation is not well understood.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Finding suitable collaboration partners remains challenging and time consuming for both the research sector and industry, particularly for small businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. To help Australian innovation precincts to mature and reach global scale, precinct leaders must grow their expertise and capability in developing effective precincts; and precinct partners must develop their collaborative capability.\\r\\n\\r\\n6.

Can we use machine learning to use other data to predict income and assets?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "27  We are seeking to help the small and informal community groups who have formed to support families or children to make their lives better. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese groups might be urban, rural or remote, they might only focus on a specific part of the community (e.g. local teenagers), or a particular issue (e.g. creating safe and supportive places to meet).  However, what they have in common is needing the right data to tell their story:\\r\\n- to explain how and why they are making a difference and who for, \\r\\n- to identify gaps and the next steps in further supporting their community, and\\r\\n- so they know where to focus next and who to collaborate with or if they need other resources. \\r\\nCan you create a way to support one of these groups (perhaps one working on an issue that you already know about) to tell their story? \\r\\n\\r\\nHaving the data they need to tell their story can help a group to:\\r\\n- clarify what they are doing and who they are helping,\\r\\n- test and re-design activities to better meet the needs in their community, \\r\\n- seek support (social, financial and political), and \\r\\n- decide when and how to collaborate with other groups with similar goals.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe NDIS demand map provides an example of how data sources might be brought together to help new group (in this case potential NDIS providers) with gaps or next steps.

       "34  There is increasing awareness around the issues relating to plastics in our oceans and also our air, water, soil and even our bodies.  Tackling this issue will require a combination of approaches. Direct participation in reducing our own single-use plastic use not only adds up to make an impact and sends a message to manufacturers that we would prefer to buy less plastic as packaging but also creates a strong level of engagement and makes as a society able to drive change at a policy level in government and industry.\\r\\nPlastic Free July has been found to be an effective way to engage people by setting themselves a challenge to give us as much or as little single-use plastic as they feel comfortable with for the month of July. Some of the changes that people make to their lives in July can become changes that they adopt for the rest of the year too.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking action for Plastic Free July is popular, yet less than 1% sign up through www.plasticfreejuly.org and social media channels. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe questions is: ‘**how do we increase direct engagement in Plastic Free July**’?\\r\\n\\r\\n-\\tA general population survey in WA shows 94% of people are concerned about plastic pollution (dataset attached)\\r\\n-\\tGlobally, waste, water pollution and plastics are considered top environmental issues (Ipsos Earth Day results attached)\\r\\n-\\tGlobally, an estimated 120 million people took action for Plastic Free July (Ipsos Global Advisor Results attached)\\r\\n-\\tIn 2017, 100,000 people signed up to PFJ web or social media.

       "39  Innovation precincts are place-based innovation ecosystems. They usually have a widely understood geographic extent; a shared sense of identity amongst those involved; and a strong set of formal and informal networks and partnerships between people and businesses, researchers, education and training organisations and government. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is strong evidence innovation precincts improve collaboration and innovation outcomes that contribute to business and economic growth. They facilitate sharing of resources, ideas, challenges and opportunities, and help businesses to access talent. They also create amenities and value for surrounding communities, and can contribute to urban renewal projects and drive regional economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many existing and planned innovation precincts in Australia. However, the scale of many of these precincts is much lower in Australia than in North America or Europe, and their full potential is arguably less widely understood. Some of the challenges and opportunities to consider are:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Information on innovation precincts’ areas of specialisation and assets, along with local supply chain opportunities, infrastructure and human capital, can guide business decisions to establish or expand operations in a particular location. It can also guide governments to target infrastructure investment and program design.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Successful innovation precincts are locally led and based on local competitive strengths, innovation potential and needs. They should be integrated into surrounding communities and into local, regional, national and international networks and supply chains.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The value of innovation precincts in encouraging end-user focused collaborative research, commercialisation and innovation is not well understood.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Finding suitable collaboration partners remains challenging and time consuming for both the research sector and industry, particularly for small businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. To help Australian innovation precincts to mature and reach global scale, precinct leaders must grow their expertise and capability in developing effective precincts; and precinct partners must develop their collaborative capability.\\r\\n\\r\\n6.

For instance, traditional financial incentives (more is good) vs the NSW Government Human Service Outcomes Framework (https://www.facs.nsw.gov.au/resources/human-services-outcomes-framework) or the New Zealand Living Standards (https://treasury.govt.nz/information-and-services/nz-economy/living-standards). \\r\\n\\r\\nYou can use one of these or make up your own, we just want to see, when set with a common challenge, whether different incentive systems get different results. \\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "      <td>The ACT Population Projections 2018 to 2058 (https://apps.treasury.act.gov.au/snapshot/demography/act) point us to some exciting and challenging facts for us to manage into the future \\r\\n\\r\\n- By the year 2022 the ACT population is projected to reach over 452,000 people from the current (2019) 420,000.\\r\\n- We are projected to reach 500,000 by 2029 and 703,000 by 2058.\\r\\n\\r\\nA growing population is more than just the numbers. The shape of our community, and our city, will also change. As our population changes, we will look for different places, and ways, to live. We will seek out new employment opportunities and new ways to travel between our homes, schools, places of work and places of recreation. We will continue to care about the impact of our actions on both the built and natural environment. We will want to become more involved in the decision-making that impacts upon our community. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is in our past that can help us build a better future? Use historical data about Canberra to help shape what our city and community looks like in 2029. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur **major prize** will be for the project that shows how you’ve used data to build a picture of the past that backs up your prediction for a better future. One that shows a full picture of Canberra 2029 in all (or the majority of) the following areas:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Transport\\r\\n- Housing\\r\\n- Business and skills\\r\\n- Environment and planning\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will also offer **four runners up prizes** for projects that predict a better future for the Canberra of 2029 focusing on at least one area of either transport, housing, business and skills, or environment and planning.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease see that attached handout to get more detail on each of the individual areas.\\r\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Innovation precincts are place-based innovation ecosystems. They usually have a widely understood geographic extent; a shared sense of identity amongst those involved; and a strong set of formal and informal networks and partnerships between people and businesses, researchers, education and training organisations and government. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is strong evidence innovation precincts improve collaboration and innovation outcomes that contribute to business and economic growth. They facilitate sharing of resources, ideas, challenges and opportunities, and help businesses to access talent. They also create amenities and value for surrounding communities, and can contribute to urban renewal projects and drive regional economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many existing and planned innovation precincts in Australia. However, the scale of many of these precincts is much lower in Australia than in North America or Europe, and their full potential is arguably less widely understood. Some of the challenges and opportunities to consider are:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Information on innovation precincts’ areas of specialisation and assets, along with local supply chain opportunities, infrastructure and human capital, can guide business decisions to establish or expand operations in a particular location. It can also guide governments to target infrastructure investment and program design.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Successful innovation precincts are locally led and based on local competitive strengths, innovation potential and needs. They should be integrated into surrounding communities and into local, regional, national and international networks and supply chains.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The value of innovation precincts in encouraging end-user focused collaborative research, commercialisation and innovation is not well understood.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Finding suitable collaboration partners remains challenging and time consuming for both the research sector and industry, particularly for small businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. To help Australian innovation precincts to mature and reach global scale, precinct leaders must grow their expertise and capability in developing effective precincts; and precinct partners must develop their collaborative capability.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Innovation precincts need to articulate and market their research capabilities and competitive strengths, including internationally Stocktake of Australian Innovation Precincts – June 2019\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther Information\\r\\nhttps://www.industry.gov.au/strategies-for-the-future/promoting-innovation-precincts</td>\n",

       "10  The ACT Population Projections 2018 to 2058 (https://apps.treasury.act.gov.au/snapshot/demography/act) point us to some exciting and challenging facts for us to manage into the future \\r\\n\\r\\n- By the year 2022 the ACT population is projected to reach over 452,000 people from the current (2019) 420,000.\\r\\n- We are projected to reach 500,000 by 2029 and 703,000 by 2058.\\r\\n\\r\\nA growing population is more than just the numbers. The shape of our community, and our city, will also change. As our population changes, we will look for different places, and ways, to live. We will seek out new employment opportunities and new ways to travel between our homes, schools, places of work and places of recreation. We will continue to care about the impact of our actions on both the built and natural environment. We will want to become more involved in the decision-making that impacts upon our community. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is in our past that can help us build a better future? Use historical data about Canberra to help shape what our city and community looks like in 2029. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur **major prize** will be for the project that shows how you’ve used data to build a picture of the past that backs up your prediction for a better future. One that shows a full picture of Canberra 2029 in all (or the majority of) the following areas:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Transport\\r\\n- Housing\\r\\n- Business and skills\\r\\n- Environment and planning\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will also offer **four runners up prizes** for projects that predict a better future for the Canberra of 2029 focusing on at least one area of either transport, housing, business and skills, or environment and planning.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease see that attached handout to get more detail on each of the individual areas.\\r\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "39  Innovation precincts are place-based innovation ecosystems. They usually have a widely understood geographic extent; a shared sense of identity amongst those involved; and a strong set of formal and informal networks and partnerships between people and businesses, researchers, education and training organisations and government. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is strong evidence innovation precincts improve collaboration and innovation outcomes that contribute to business and economic growth. They facilitate sharing of resources, ideas, challenges and opportunities, and help businesses to access talent. They also create amenities and value for surrounding communities, and can contribute to urban renewal projects and drive regional economic growth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many existing and planned innovation precincts in Australia. However, the scale of many of these precincts is much lower in Australia than in North America or Europe, and their full potential is arguably less widely understood. Some of the challenges and opportunities to consider are:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Information on innovation precincts’ areas of specialisation and assets, along with local supply chain opportunities, infrastructure and human capital, can guide business decisions to establish or expand operations in a particular location. It can also guide governments to target infrastructure investment and program design.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Successful innovation precincts are locally led and based on local competitive strengths, innovation potential and needs. They should be integrated into surrounding communities and into local, regional, national and international networks and supply chains.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The value of innovation precincts in encouraging end-user focused collaborative research, commercialisation and innovation is not well understood.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Finding suitable collaboration partners remains challenging and time consuming for both the research sector and industry, particularly for small businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. To help Australian innovation precincts to mature and reach global scale, precinct leaders must grow their expertise and capability in developing effective precincts; and precinct partners must develop their collaborative capability.\\r\\n\\r\\n6. Innovation precincts need to articulate and market their research capabilities and competitive strengths, including internationally Stocktake of Australian Innovation Precincts – June 2019\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther Information\\r\\nhttps://www.industry.gov.au/strategies-for-the-future/promoting-innovation-precincts   \n",
       "51  As our urban and regional centres grow we increasingly rely on public services to efficiently and sustainably transport citizens. The winning entry will use data and modern technologies to drive a positive public transport outcome. We encourage teams to adopt a novel technical approach and to 'think big'. Your entry may focus on public transport in the context of a specific locality, region, state or country - but should offer insights or capabilities that can be broadly applied.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
